filt \- An experimental implementation of Moore machine filter for timed
and untimed pattern matching
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The tool \f[B]filt\f[] reads timed or untimed word from standard input,
writing masked timed or untimed word to standard output.
The tool \f[B]filt\f[] is an experimental implementation of Moore
machine filter for timed and untimed pattern matching.
We believe such a filter is useful in the following situation.
.IP \[bu] 2
When we transfer some data via network, we can reduce the data size by
filtering out unnecessary part.
.IP \[bu] 2
When pattern matching procedure takes too much time, we can reduce the
execution time by reducing the input size by filter.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
.B \f[B]\-h\f[], \f[B]\[en]help\f[]
Print a help message.
\f[B]\-V\f[], \f[B]\[en]version\f[]
.RS
.RE
Print the version.
\f[B]\-f\f[] \f[I]file\f[], \f[B]\[en]automaton\f[] \f[I]file\f[]

.RE
Read a (timed) automaton from \f[I]file\f[].
\f[B]\-u\f[], \f[B]\[en]untimed\f[] (default)

Untimed filtering mode.

.SH Examples
.PP
The command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
filt\ \-f\ nfa.dot\ <\ word.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
read the word from \f[I]word.txt\f[] and write the masked word to
standard output.
It masks the part unnecessary for the pattern matching of the NFA in
\f[I]nfa.dot\f[].
.PP
The command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
filt\ \-t\ \-f\ ta.dot\ <\ timed_word.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
read the timed word from \f[I]timed_word.txt\f[] and write the masked
timed word to standard output.
It masks the part unnecessary for the pattern matching of the TA in
\f[I]ta.dot\f[].
